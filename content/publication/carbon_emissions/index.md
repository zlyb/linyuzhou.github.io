# Abstract
abstract: This paper investigates how climate-related risks affect the trading behavior of bondmutual funds and tests the underlying mechanisms. We find that mutual funds collectivelysell corporate bonds issued by firms with high carbon emissions, driven by funds’concerns about carbon-related redemption risks, rather than by a permanent shift infunds’ investing preferences. Higher carbon exposures in mutual fund portfolios leadto more investor outflows, and bonds tend to experience more intensive selling if theirholding mutual funds have higher flow-to-carbon sensitivity. Bonds issued by highcarbonfirms experience worse liquidity conditions, especially when concerns aboutcarbon-related risks heighten.
