# Abstract
abstract: This paper investigates the utilization of soft information in firms' earnings conference calls by short sellers in trading corporate bonds. The results indicate increases in short-sale activities for bonds issued by firms that have more negative earnings conference calls. This relation cannot be attributed to looser short-sale constraints, such as more lendable shares or lower lending fees. Instead, bond short sellers exhibit adeptness in processing the soft information in earnings conference calls, particularly the information related to default risks. Bonds of firms with more negative conference calls are more prone to downgrades and defaults, and exhibit lower returns in the future. Additionally, there is a significant spillover effect of the tone of earnings conference calls conducted by public firms on the shorting volumes of bonds issued by private industry peers.
