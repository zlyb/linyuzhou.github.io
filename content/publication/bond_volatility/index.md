# Abstract
abstract: A positive cross-sectional relation between returns and lagged idiosyncratic volatility (IVOL) obtains in the corporate bond market because dealers are less willing to accept high IVOL bonds into inventory during low funding liquidity periods and the subsequent relaxation of this constraint causes an increase in prices. An exogenous shock to funding liquidity due to the Volcker rule (which limited the provision of liquidity by corporate bond dealers) drives the identification. Both, the time-series shock to the supply of funding liquidity and the cross-sectional variations in the demand for funding liquidity following the Volcker rule, impact the bond IVOL-return relation.
